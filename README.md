# MshcHost

My most recent 5AM project.

A project made to unzip and host an MSHC help file as a website. Inspired by Progress' (Telerik's) awful Sitefinity API documentation file which doesn't even work in the Visual Studio help system. 

Written with Python and Flask. Uses `tqdm` for progress bars. Don't trust the requirements.txt, I haven't frozen the requirements yet.
